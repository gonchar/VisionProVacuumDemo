Source code for a demo project which showcases how to work with Apple Vision Pro and RealityKit, ARKit APIs.

Here I showcase how to work with 
* ARKit: head tracking, hand tracking, scene understanding
* Load & play sounds
* Process collisions
* Work with underlying mesh data using MTLBuffers

I wish I had this opensource example before. Happy to share it with community.

This project is part of [DevNotes bundle I sell on gumroad](https://sgonchar.gumroad.com/l/realitykit-visionos). if you are interesting in building native epxeriences for Apple Vision Pro using RealityKit I highly recommend this, it will save you countless of hours in debugging.
